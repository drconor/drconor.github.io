Any given cell may be undergoing millions of biological processes, signalling cascades, chemical and cellular interactions at any given moment in time. In healthy cells, all of these processes must work in perfect symphony to ensure normal cell function. Yet, deviations within such cellular networks, whether spurred by mutations or external stimuli, can drive cells towards pathological states and ultimately disease. Deciphering these complex mechanisms has historically posed challenges for scientists. However, DeepLife\u2019s Cell Blueprint emerges as a beacon of clarity amidst the tangled web of cellular interactions, offering a paradigm shift in cellular interactome visualisation.</p>"},{"location":"CellBlueprint/#limitations-of-classical-network-visualisation-approaches","title":"Limitations of classical network visualisation approaches","text":"<p>The default molecular interaction network displayed on the Cell Blueprint is based on DeepLife\u2019s proprietary human interactome. Classically, interactome networks are represented with nodes, which represent genes, proteins, or other molecules; and edges, which represent connections or interactions between nodes. In classical network visualisation approaches, nodes are typically depicted with a shape such as a circle, and interactions are represented by lines (edges) between these nodes.</p> <p>Although intuitive, classical approaches have two key limitations, particularly with regard to increasing network complexity:</p> <ul> <li>Since the positioning of edges is arbitrary, they can frequently overlap with each other, which obfuscates the paths of individual links and creates large numbers of meaningless intersections between edges.</li> <li>In classical representation approaches, edges can also intersect with multiple nodes, even where a true interaction does not exist, causing ambiguity in interpretation.</li> </ul> <p>Unless mitigated, these limitations can give rise to so-called \u201cinteraction hairballs\u201d in representations of interactome networks, where increasing network complexity corresponds to decreasing ease of interpretation (Figure 1a).</p>  Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the Cell Blueprint layout construction.   a.  Starting interaction \u201chairball\u201d. A particular node and its interactions are highlighted in blue. The partners of the highlighted nodes are shown in black filling. In this representation,  interpretation can be challenging as a result of large numbers of overlapping nodes and edges.    b.  Visual representation of the hierarchical community detection, reminiscent of dendrograms. The original highlighted interactions are represented as passing through the hierarchy branches.   c. Conversion of the hierarchical clustering branches into graph edges.   d. Final Cell Blueprint layout. The original highlighted interactions are represented as passing through \u201cconduits\u201d."}]}
